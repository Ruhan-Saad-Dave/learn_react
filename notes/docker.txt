# The Docker Compose Workflow (Daily Use)
- Build and Start: Creates images and starts containers in the background.
docker compose up -d --build

- Stop and Remove: Stops containers and removes the internal network created by Compose.
docker compose down

- View Status: See which services are running and their ports.
docker compose ps

- View Logs: Real-time output from your app (useful for debugging code errors).
docker compose logs -f 

# Image Management & Docker Hub
- Login: Required before you can push.
docker login

- Tag an Image: Create a versioned alias for a local image.
docker tag local-image-name yourusername/repository:v1.0

- Push to Hub: Upload your tagged image.
docker push yourusername/repository:v1.0

- Pull from Hub: Download an image to a new machine.
docker pull yourusername/repository:v1.0 

- List Images: See all images stored on your laptop.
docker images 

# Debugging & "Under the Hood"
- Interactive Terminal: "Jump inside" a running container to run Linux commands.
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash 

- Resource Usage: See live CPU and RAM consumption.
docker stats

- Inspect Metadata: See IP addresses, environment variables, and config.
docker inspect <container_name>

# Cleanup (Keeping your Laptop Fast)
- Remove a Container:
docker rm -f <container_name>

- Remove an Image:
docker rmi <image_id_or_name>

- The "Nuclear" Option (System Prune): Removes all stopped containers, unused networks, and "dangling" images (leftovers from failed builds).
docker system prune
Add -a at the end if you want to delete all unused images, not just dangling ones.

# Practical Example: The "Update" Loop
If you make a change to your code and want to push it:
1. Build/Test locally: docker compose up -d --build
2. Tag it: docker tag project-app yourusername/react-app:v1.2
3. Push it: docker push yourusername/react-app:v1.2
